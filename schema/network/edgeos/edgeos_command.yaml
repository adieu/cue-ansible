short_description: Run one or more commands on EdgeOS devices
description:
  - This command module allows running one or more commands on a remote
    device running EdgeOS, such as the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter.
  - This module does not support running commands in configuration mode.
  - Certain C(show) commands in EdgeOS produce many lines of output and
    use a custom pager that can cause this module to hang.  If the
    value of the environment variable C(ANSIBLE_EDGEOS_TERMINAL_LENGTH)
    is not set, the default number of 10000 is used.
  - "This is a network module and requires C(connection: network_cli)
    in order to work properly."
  - For more information please see the L(Network Guide,../network/getting_started/index.html).
options:
  commands:
    description:
      - The commands or ordered set of commands that should be run against the
        remote device. The output of the command is returned to the playbook.
        If the C(wait_for) argument is provided, the module is not returned
        until the condition is met or the number of retries is exceeded.
    required: True
  wait_for:
    description:
      - Causes the task to wait for a specific condition to be met before
        moving forward. If the condition is not met before the specified
        number of retries is exceeded, the task will fail.
    required: False
  match:
    description:
      - Used in conjunction with C(wait_for) to create match policy. If set to
        C(all), then all conditions in C(wait_for) must be met. If set to
        C(any), then only one condition must match.
    required: False
    default: 'all'
    choices: ['any', 'all']
  retries:
    description:
      - Number of times a command should be tried before it is considered failed.
        The command is run on the target device and evaluated against the
        C(wait_for) conditionals.
    required: False
    default: 10
  interval:
    description:
      - The number of seconds to wait between C(retries) of the command.
    required: False
    default: 1

notes:
  - Tested against EdgeOS 1.9.7
  - Running C(show system boot-messages all) will cause the module to hang since
    EdgeOS is using a custom pager setting to display the output of that command.
