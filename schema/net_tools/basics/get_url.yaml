module: get_url
short_description: Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to node
description:
     - Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to the remote server. The remote
       server I(must) have direct access to the remote resource.
     - By default, if an environment variable C(<protocol>_proxy) is set on
       the target host, requests will be sent through that proxy. This
       behaviour can be overridden by setting a variable for this task
       (see `setting the environment
       <https://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_environment.html>`_),
       or by using the use_proxy option.
     - HTTP redirects can redirect from HTTP to HTTPS so you should be sure that
       your proxy environment for both protocols is correct.
     - From Ansible 2.4 when run with C(--check), it will do a HEAD request to validate the URL but
       will not download the entire file or verify it against hashes.
     - For Windows targets, use the M(win_get_url) module instead.
version_added: '0.6'
options:
  url:
    description:
      - HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL in the form (http|https|ftp)://[user[:pass]]@host.domain[:port]/path
    type: str
    required: true
  dest:
    description:
      - Absolute path of where to download the file to.
      - If C(dest) is a directory, either the server provided filename or, if
        none provided, the base name of the URL on the remote server will be
        used. If a directory, C(force) has no effect.
      - If C(dest) is a directory, the file will always be downloaded
        (regardless of the C(force) option), but replaced only if the contents changed..
    type: path
    required: true
  tmp_dest:
    description:
      - Absolute path of where temporary file is downloaded to.
      - When run on Ansible 2.5 or greater, path defaults to ansible's remote_tmp setting
      - When run on Ansible prior to 2.5, it defaults to C(TMPDIR), C(TEMP) or C(TMP) env variables or a platform specific value.
      - U(https://docs.python.org/2/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.tempdir)
    type: path
    version_added: '2.1'
  force:
    description:
      - If C(yes) and C(dest) is not a directory, will download the file every
        time and replace the file if the contents change. If C(no), the file
        will only be downloaded if the destination does not exist. Generally
        should be C(yes) only for small local files.
      - Prior to 0.6, this module behaved as if C(yes) was the default.
      - Alias C(thirsty) has been deprecated and will be removed in 2.13.
    type: bool
    default: no
    aliases: [ thirsty ]
    version_added: '0.7'
  backup:
    description:
      - Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get
        the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '2.1'
  sha256sum:
    description:
      - If a SHA-256 checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
        destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure
        its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.
        This option is deprecated. Use C(checksum) instead.
    default: ''
    version_added: "1.3"
  checksum:
    description:
      - 'If a checksum is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
        destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure
        its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.
        Format: <algorithm>:<checksum|url>, e.g. checksum="sha256:D98291AC[...]B6DC7B97",
        checksum="sha256:http://example.com/path/sha256sum.txt"'
      - If you worry about portability, only the sha1 algorithm is available
        on all platforms and python versions.
      - The third party hashlib library can be installed for access to additional algorithms.
      - Additionally, if a checksum is passed to this parameter, and the file exist under
        the C(dest) location, the I(destination_checksum) would be calculated, and if
        checksum equals I(destination_checksum), the file download would be skipped
        (unless C(force) is true). If the checksum does not equal I(destination_checksum),
        the destination file is deleted.
    type: str
    default: ''
    version_added: "2.0"
  use_proxy:
    description:
      - if C(no), it will not use a proxy, even if one is defined in
        an environment variable on the target hosts.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  validate_certs:
    description:
      - If C(no), SSL certificates will not be validated.
      - This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed certificates.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  timeout:
    description:
      - Timeout in seconds for URL request.
    type: int
    default: 10
    version_added: '1.8'
  headers:
    description:
        - Add custom HTTP headers to a request in hash/dict format.
        - The hash/dict format was added in Ansible 2.6.
        - Previous versions used a C("key:value,key:value") string format.
        - The C("key:value,key:value") string format is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.10.
    type: raw
    version_added: '2.0'
  url_username:
    description:
      - The username for use in HTTP basic authentication.
      - This parameter can be used without C(url_password) for sites that allow empty passwords.
      - Since version 2.8 you can also use the C(username) alias for this option.
    type: str
    aliases: ['username']
    version_added: '1.6'
  url_password:
    description:
        - The password for use in HTTP basic authentication.
        - If the C(url_username) parameter is not specified, the C(url_password) parameter will not be used.
        - Since version 2.8 you can also use the 'password' alias for this option.

    aliases: ['password']
    version_added: '1.6'
  force_basic_auth:
    description:
      - Force the sending of the Basic authentication header upon initial request.
      - httplib2, the library used by the uri module only sends authentication information when a webservice
        responds to an initial request with a 401 status. Since some basic auth services do not properly
        send a 401, logins will fail.
    type: bool
    default: no
    version_added: '2.0'
  client_cert:
    description:
      - PEM formatted certificate chain file to be used for SSL client authentication.
