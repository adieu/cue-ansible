  name:
    description:
      - A Python library name
    required: true
  virtualenv:
    description:

        I(virtualenv) does not exist, it is created automatically
  virtualenv_site_packages:
    version_added: "1.1"
    description:
      - Whether the virtual environment will inherit packages from the
        global site-packages directory.  Note that if this setting is
        changed on an already existing virtual environment it will not
        have any effect, the environment must be deleted and newly
        created.
    type: bool
    default: 'no'
  virtualenv_command:
    version_added: "1.1"
    description:
      - The command to create the virtual environment with. For example
        C(pyvenv), C(virtualenv), C(virtualenv2).
    default: virtualenv
  executable:
    description:
      - The explicit executable or a pathname to the executable to be used to
        run easy_install for a specific version of Python installed in the
        system. For example C(easy_install-3.3), if there are both Python 2.7
        and 3.3 installations in the system and you want to run easy_install
        for the Python 3.3 installation.
    version_added: "1.3"
  state:
    version_added: "2.0"
    description:
      - The desired state of the library. C(latest) ensures that the latest version is installed.
    choices: [present, latest]
    default: present
notes:
    - Please note that the C(easy_install) module can only install Python
      libraries. Thus this module is not able to remove libraries. It is
      generally recommended to use the M(pip) module which you can first install
      using M(easy_install).
    - Also note that I(virtualenv) must be installed on the remote host if the
      C(virtualenv) parameter is specified.
